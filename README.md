Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

I hope that we meet in another life

There is a line you must draw
Between your dream world and reality
Ideas that fall under shadows of theories that stand tall
Thoughts that grow narrow upon being verbally released

You know that good lives make bad stories

Yeah, I tried
To get it off my mind
To leave it all behind
Don't wanna make it worse
I'm gonna make it work
```

Lyric references aside though, was nice meetin y'all, gonna delete this account

If you stay in IT (and don't go live in a forest like me) please contribute to FOSS projects instead of wasting your time on proprietary shit.

Cya!

_hxr404_

PS. Got all the lyric references? Nice! I like you. If we ever meet IRL feel free to ask me about it :)
