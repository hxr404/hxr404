# Contributing

## Liking and Sharing
Give my Repos a Star<br>
Like things that I post<br>
Follow me on GitHub, Twitter, Youtube, Twitch, Insta, FB, Reddit, StackOverflow etc.<br>
Vote for my Bot at top.gg and other bot lists<br>
and tell your friends how great my stuff is :D

## Testing and Feedback
Write issues!<br>
Report Bugs, do Feature Requests, give Feedback etc.<br>
Try experimental/beta Versions and test everything out!<br>
Your feedback helps me improving things even more!<br>


## For Developers
You can contribute to the code. Create a Fork, make your changes and open a pull request.<br>
You can also reach me out and we can code something together.<br>
If you want to improve other things than the code (e.g. Readme) its also appreciated.<br>
Like before, just create a pull request and I'll look into it.<br>
If you don't know what to code, look into the Projects Section of my Repos.


## Other
You can directly contribute to the repos.
Write Wiki Pages, create Design, improve things, etc.
For Contributing to a project you don't need to code. For Example I need a Theme for ExpireBot and a Logo.
